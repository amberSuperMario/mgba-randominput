# mgba-randominput
A simple Lua script for [mGBA](https://mgba.io/) to input random button presses automatically. The script will wait a random number of frames (1-60 by default), press a random button, hold it for a random number of frames (1-180 by default), release the button, and then start the whole process over.

Requires a development build of mGBA (v0.10 or higher). Currently excludes Select, L, and R, because I'm using it for Pokemon Emerald, and that made for a smoother experience.
